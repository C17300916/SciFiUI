# Description of the assignment

My User Interface was originally inspired by the idea of Iron Man. I wanted to create an interface that could be seen inside a helmet of some sort of flying suit through space. I started this project by designing the space in the background, this took a lot of time as I decided to use random variables for the colours of the planets and also initially the size. 

# Instructions

I added in some visual instructions to my system also but the instructions for my system are as follows:

-*SPACE* ==> Applies boost to the UI, you should visually be able to see the stars / planets move faster, the fuel level should decrease faster, the boost level should also decrease, and the speedometer should increase to it's boost speed.

-*S*     ==> Allows the user to shoot a planet when the target is on it, you should see the planet dissapear and the bullet count decrease in Ammo.

-*e*     ==> Enables a user to exit a pressed button like map, you should see the map dissapear.

-*mouseClick* ==> on a button will open them and display different objects eg. a map

This is code:

```Java
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```

So is this without specifying the language:

```
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```
